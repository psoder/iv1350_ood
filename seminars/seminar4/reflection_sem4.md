# Reflection About Seminar 3

What are your conclusions about this seminar? Try to answer the following questions.

## Approximately how much time, including lectures and exercises, have you spent preparing for the seminar?

Since I did seminar 3, 4, and some of the higher grade tasks it's hard to approximate
how much time was spent on this seminar. I would guess that I've spent maybe 20
hours in total on writing (and rewriting) the program. However, that included quite
a lot of learning since I haven't used Kotlin previously. On the report and documentation
I would guess about 3-4 hours.

## What have you learned from the problems presented?

Honestly, probably nothing. It might be because I have programed a fair bit
previously and have come in contact with more or less all concepts in the course
(and the new ones are pretty simple). I hadn't heard of the strategy pattern
previously, although I have written code similar to it previously.

## What was difficult and what was easy?

The most dificult part was being concise, it's like Mark Twain said, "I didn't
have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.". While I think
I've done a pretty good job of not having anything unecessary I know there are some
parts that could be simplified.

## How have you worked when solving the problems?

Mostly in small bursts.It was a very iterative process and I had to go back and
change the things I'd allready written a few times. I started by implementing the
observer pattern, after that I went on to implement the strategy and Singleton
patterns.

## What questions remain regarding the problems?

Nothing really.

## Do you have any suggestions regarding the course? Both suggestions for this course instance and for coming years are of interest

Make the program] be a somewhat complex program so that it dosen't feel like using
an excavator to build a sand castle. One easy way of doing this is to require
all functionality in the requirements to be implemented and then some. the
additional functionality wouldnt take that much additional effort since most
of the program is pretty boilerplatey.
