# Reflection About Seminar 1 (5)

What are your conclusions about this seminar? Try to answer the following questions.

## Approximately how much time, including lectures and exercises, have you spent preparing for the seminar?

On seminar 1 I spent maybe three hours with the report and model and maybe three
on lectures and reading.

## What have you learned from the problems presented?

It's hard to model in a good way.

## What was difficult and what was easy?

Adapting the requirements to a model was the hardest part since there's a lot of
umming and aaing over if it really is the correct way to model.

The easiest part was making the SSD since it was pretty much just copy-pasting
the requirements.

## How have you worked when solving the problems?

Mostly in small bursts.It was a very iterative process and I had to go back and
change the things I'd allready written a few times.

## What questions remain regarding the problems?

Nothing really.

## Do you have any suggestions regarding the course? Both suggestions for this course instance and for coming years are of interest

Nope.
