# Reflection About Seminar 2

What are your conclusions about this seminar? Try to answer the following questions.

## Approximately how much time, including lectures and exercises, have you spent preparing for the seminar?

I would guess about two hours reading the book and maybe five hours designing.

## What have you learned from the problems presented?

That I should have made several small communication digarams instead of one large.
It would have been much easier to work with and more logical.

## What was difficult and what was easy?

It was dificult designing without writing any code because I feel like it's alwyas
easier designing when I can test things out and see what works and what doesn't.
As with everything I now realize that I should have been more explicit when
describing the program.

The easiest part of the seminar was understanding the task and the different concepts.
I don't know how much of that is that I've worked with the MVC pattern before and
how much is it was well explained.

## How have you worked when solving the problems?

Mostly in small bursts. I started by creating a basic foundation (creating the layers).
After that I went thorugh the requirements and made things up as I realized they
were needed. It was a very iterative process and I had to go back and change the
previous things several times.

## What questions remain regarding the problems?

If the soulution is the correct or what is incrorrect in it. Other than that I
think it's pretty solid.

## Do you have any suggestions regarding the course? Both suggestions for this course instance and for coming years are of interest

A bit more information about communication diagrams under 5.4 in the course book
wouldn't hurt.
